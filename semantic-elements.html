    <h1> Semantic Elements </h1>
    <p> To understand what a Semantic Element in HTML is first we need to define two things; One whatâ€™s a HTML element,
      and two what is the meaning of the word semantic.<br>
        According to W3C <q>an element is the basic building block of HTML and is typically made up of two tags:
          an opening tag and a closing tag</q>. So basically, all HTML code is made of a bunch of elements. <br>
          Some examples of elements are <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;</code>, and many more.<br>
        Semantic is defined as <q>of or relating to meaning in language</q> by the Merriam Webster Dictionary.<br>
        So, when we talk about Semantic Elements in HTML we are referring to an element that has meaning for both
        the browser and the developer. For example, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is a semantic element since it can be
        understood by both the machine and the person.<br>
